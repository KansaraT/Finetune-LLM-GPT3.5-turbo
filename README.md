**OVERVIEW:**

Integrating a database (Preferably a graph database like Neo4j), with any Large Language Model (LLM) such as gpt-3.5-turbo. 
The integration allows querying the database in natural language and receiving responses in a human-readable format. 

**Sample Dataset**: Use a publicly available dataset, such as a movie dataset (including fields like movie name, genre, actors, etc.)
