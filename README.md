**OVERVIEW:**

Integrating a database (Preferably a graph database like Neo4j), with any Large Language Model (LLM) such as gpt-3.5-turbo. 
The integration allows querying the database in natural language and receiving responses in a human-readable format. 

**Sample Dataset**: Use a publicly available dataset, such as a movie dataset (including fields like movie name, genre, actors, etc.)

**Frameworks:** LangChain to facilitate the interaction between the database and the LLM.

**Expected Outcome:** The final deliverable allows natural language querying of the database via LLM, with responses formatted in natural language. For instance, querying "What is the Genre of Titanic?" yields a response like "Titanic is of Romance Adventure genre."
